# Run
1. Generate connectivity matrix of MC: `1.soc_construct.ipynb`, resulting in connectivity matrix `isn_1.2_0.9.txt`
2. Modeling MC during movement execution of delayed-reach task: `2. opt_model+submodel.ipynb`
3. Compare similarity bettween real and simulated neural data: `3. similarity.ipynb`
4. Modeling MC during delayed-reach task (preparation and execution): `4. whole.ipynb`
